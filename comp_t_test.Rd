\title{Give appropriate t test}
\usage{
comp_t_test(x, y = NULL, mu = 0, independent = T, basic.info = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A (non-empty) numeric vector (ie. integers, doubles).}

\item{y}{An optional (non-empty) numeric or character vector and defaults to NULL. If y is a character vector, it should has the same length as your x input and it can be dichotomized. If y is a numeric vector, it will be regarded as another sample.}

\item{mu}{A number indicating the true value of the mean}

\item{independence}{A logical value indicating whether two variables are independent or not (if you want to test for two samples). It's not necessary if you want to do a one-sample or paired test.}

\item{basic_info}{logical value indicating whether to print the numeric and graphic summaries.}
}
\value{
An object of a list. The output has the following properties:
\itemize{
\item Results of normality test (satisfied or violated)
\item Results of homogeneity test (satisfied or violated)
\item The p-value from the appropriate test for the given data set
\item The specific name of test used for the data set
\item The final conclusion for the test
\item Graphics if necessary
\item Further messages for some specific cases.
}
}
\description{
Performs appropriate t test or alternative test based on the assumption tests, particularly normality and homogeneity for the data set.

\examples{
data("mtcars")
x <- mtcars$hp

y <- as.character(mtcars$vs)
comp_t_test(x, y,independent = T, basic.info = T)
