\title{Give appropriate anova test}
\usage{
comp_anova(x, y, basic_info = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A (non-empty) vector of characters or numbers (ie. integers, doubles).}

\item{y}{A (non-empty) vector of characters or numbers (ie. integers, doubles). If x is a character vector, y should be a numeric one with the same length as x. If x is a numerical vector, y should be a character one with the same length as x.}

\item{basic_info}{logical value, whether to print the numeric and graphic summaries.}
}
\value{
An object of a list. The output has the following properties:
\itemize{
\item The groups are balanced or not
\item Results of normality test (satisfied or violated)
\item Results of homogeneity test (satisfied or violated)
\item The p-value from the appropriate test for the given data set
\item The specific name of test used for the data set
\item The final conclusion for the test
\item Graphics if necessary
\item Further messages for some specific cases.
}
}
\description{
Performs appropriate anova test or alternative test based on the assumption tests, particularly normality and homogeneity for the data set.
